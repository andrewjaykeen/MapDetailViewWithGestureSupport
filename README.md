MapDetailViewWithGestureSupport
===============================

This is an iOS sample app of a gesture-enabled detail view, inspired by Redfin's iOS app.   

The class 'AJKDraggableDetailView' inherits from the core ios 'UIView' class.   To use in your own app, just copy AJKDraggableDetailView.h and AJKDraggableDetailView.m and use it as you would use a UIView.  

AJKDraggableDetailView is not map-specific at all, but fits nicely in the context of a detail view for a map.  It's an alternative to switching screens entirely to go to a detail view after the user has chosen a point/pin on the map.
